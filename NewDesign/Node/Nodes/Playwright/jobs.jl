The extension allows users to comment and vote on any site (indexed by URL). It allows users to follow other users to find their comments and has a direct message (DM) and group chat features. It pairs with a backend server that it connects to, written in C# .NET that has an admin panel for information and moderation. The precise issues and milestones are shown below.\n\nMilestone 1:\nFixing the Settings Screen:\nThe Issue: Users can't update their Nickname, Password or Bio on the settings screen.\nTechnical Hypothesis: Possibly a missing Authorization header in the request sent by settings.js.\nSolving the Disappearing Avatars:\nThe Issue: User avatars sometimes get lost after being uploaded.\nTechnical Hypothesis: We believe this is a server-side issue. Possibly an issue with the correct folder (wwwroot/images/avatars/) not being automatically created.\nMaking the Leaderboard Accurate:\nThe Issue: The leaderboard sometimes breaks at the end of the month.\nTechnical Hypothesis: Update the back-end to handle vote aggregation and time-boundary calculations properly.\nInvestigating the Ad Feature:\nThe Issue: The opt-in ads are broken.\nTechnical Hypothesis: Find a replacement for the third-party domain used for this feature or remove it if that is not possible.\n\n\nFixing ICO Site Extension API:\nThe Extension server needs to query our ICO site to get the user\u2019s XCV balance and recently the ICO site API server has begun failing. We have other freelancers working on fixing the API, but if for some reason they are unable to accomplish this, it needs to be done here.\nThis milestone will be removed if the problem is fixed before milestone 1 is completed.\n\nMilestone 2:\nFixing Auto-Login:\nThe Issue: The \"remember me\" login feature is unreliable. It does log you in without the password if you click on the login button, but it doesn\u2019t show that it will do that and it should log you in automatically.\nTechnical Hypothesis: The issue is likely related to the Manifest V3 service worker lifecycle. The recommended approach is to move the JWT from cookies into chrome.storage.local, which is the modern, accepted practice and should make the silent login flow much more reliable.\n\nImproving Chat & Saving Drafts:\nThe Issue: Users lose their work if they click away from the extension, and the chat doesn't behave like other modern apps.\nTechnical Hypothesis: This appears to be entirely client-side. Use local sessionStorage to automatically save drafts of comments and DMs, and add a simple key handler to implement the \"Enter to send / Shift+Enter for new line\" functionality.\nCleaning Up Group Chat UI:\nThe Issue: A non-functional \"heart\" icon appears in group DMs.\nTechnical Hypothesis: This is a minor UI fix. The front-end templating already includes an isGroup flag that we can use to conditionally hide the icon.\nImproving Social Login:\nThe Issue: We aren't capturing user emails on social sign-up. Users instead get a random unknown name.\nTechnical Hypothesis: The front-end will need a new prompt after the OAuth callback. On the back-end, the primary task is to create and run a new database migration using Entity Framework to add a unique email column to the user table.\n\nMilestone 3:\nBuilding User Search:\nThe Goal: Allow users to search for each other.\nThe Plan: Implement a front end UI and proper database indexes for the /api/Users/Search endpoint.\nCreating a Notifications System:\nThe Goal: A new page for users to see notifications and manage their preferences.\nThe Plan: This is the most significant new build. The plan involves creating the UI on the client and, on the back-end, building out a full CRUD API for the existing Notification entity, then connecting it to the existing SignalR setup for real-time alerts.\nUpdate the back end from .NET Core 3.1 to a modern LTS version like .NET 8.\nThe Goal: Update the back end version to a version with active support without loss of any features\nThe Plan: Update to the new version and fix any issues that arise.\nSkills required\nJavascript\nC# and the .NET framework\nFantastic attention to detail\nDetailed Quality Assurance", "skills": [".NET", "API Development", ".NET", "API Development", "Backend Development", "Database Management", "Frontend Development"], "ClientRating": 4.9, "ClientReviews": 8, "timestamp": "2025-07-28T05:04:14.385609+00:00"}

The system must automatically generate monthly invoices, renew subscriptions, and, in case of failed payments, grant a 48-hour grace period with reminder notifications via email and WhatsApp. If the payment is not completed within the grace period, the client\u2019s store should be automatically suspended until payment is received. Additionally, a clean and simple landing page should be created in both Arabic and English, showcasing the platform\u2019s features, the single subscription plan, and a sign-up link, with future scalability in mind for adding more services. Notifications regarding subscription status, invoices, and renewals should be configured to be sent via email and WhatsApp, either manually or automatically. An admin dashboard should be included, allowing me to view each store\u2019s sales, my commission earnings, and manage payouts manually. I must also be able to change the subscription pricing myself without needing a developer. Finally, the entire project should be delivered as a fully functional, tested, and secure live system, with correct and verified integration of the Amwali Pay payment gateway.

The main goal is the accurate reading of playing card values in real-time, in the game of Baccarat at online casinos with live dealers, and in accordance with the configuration set in the application's Settings area, which will command the closure and subsequent reopening of the same website that was open (the online casino page).\n\n\n\n\nProject Description\n\n\n\nThe software must be capable of operating on any online casino that offers live dealer Baccarat, regardless of the software provider (e.g., Evolution Gaming, Ezugi, etc.) or the user\u2019s screen resolution (from 720p screens to next-gen UHD displays).\n\n\n\nRequired Features:\n\n1. Real-Time Recognition of Baccarat Cards:\n\n\u25cf The application must identify and read the value of cards dealt in live Baccarat tables at online casinos.\n\n\u25cf Recognition must be highly accurate (100%) and in real-time (15-30 FPS latency) despite slight variations in card position (up to 7mm displacement).\n\n\u25cf Computer vision must be implemented using lightweight neural networks (e.g., YOLOv5 or YOLOv8) for dynamic object detection.\n\n\u25cf The system must capture the full screen and process it to recognize cards, IMPORTANT: adapting to any screen configuration or resolution without relying on fixed coordinates.\n\n\n\n2. Dynamic Reading of Casino URL:\n\n\u25cf The software must be able to identify and read the URL of the currently active online casino in the browser.\n\n\n\n3. Settings System and Automated Closing Rules (Trigger):\n\n\u25cf The application must include a graphical configuration interface accessible via a \"gear\" icon on the main window (top-right corner).\n\n\u25cf In this area, the user will define \u201ctrigger\u201d rules based on the sum of the dealt cards.\n\n\u25cf Rules for the first two cards (PLAYER and BANKER):\n\n\u25cf The user will specify two-card sum values for PLAYER (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9) and BANKER that will trigger the rule.\n\n\u25cf If the sum of the first two cards of PLAYER or BANKER (according to configuration) matches the defined values, the software must execute an immediate action.\n\n\u25cf Rules for the third card (PLAYER and BANKER):\n\n\u25cf The user may configure rules for when PLAYER and/or BANKER receives a third card and the total sum of all three cards reaches a specified value.\n\n\u25cf Trigger Action: When one of the trigger rules is met:\n\n\u25cf The software must immediately close the entire browser where the online casino is being played. This shutdown must be abrupt, without waiting for the end of the round or animations.\n\n\u25cf After closing, the software must wait 3 seconds (time.sleep) and then reopen the same browser at the URL that was active before the shutdown.\n\n\u25cf The closing and reopening functionality must be compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nUser Interface (UI):\n\n\n\n\u25cf The interface should be simple and display the recognized card values one by one as they appear on the screen.\n\n\u25cf Card values should be displayed in plain text format using Arial font, size 24 or 26, clearly spaced and centered on the interface.\n\n\u25cf When a \u201ctrigger\u201d event is activated, a quick on-screen message should display: \"Cerrando ventana por reglas aplicadas\".\n\n\n\nKey Technical Considerations:\n\n\n\n\u25cf Programming Language: Python.\n\n\u25cf Computer Vision: Use of libraries such as OpenCV and detection model frameworks (YOLOv5/YOLOv8).\n\n\u25cf Web/Desktop Automation: Possible use of libraries like `subprocess`, `webbrowser`, `PyAutoGUI`, or `psutil` for browser control.\n\n\u25cf Graphical Interface: `tkinter` or `PyQt` can be used for the UI.\n\n\u25cf Delivery of the complete Python source code.\n\n\u25cf It is appreciated that the points presented under \"Key Technical Considerations\" are the ones used by the developer applying.\n\n\u25cf Additional: We do not want to work with Tesseract OCR. We do not want to work via screenshot with a fixed region or using screen coordinates.\n\n\nWe expect a precise and efficient solution that meets the detailed requirements.\n\nPrevious experience in automation projects, computer vision, and system process management is highly valued.", "skills": ["Computer Vision", "Desktop Application", "Computer Vision", "Desktop Application", "Graphical User Interface (GUI)", "Image Processing", "OpenCV"], "ClientRating": 5.0, "ClientReviews": 8, "timestamp": "2025-07-28T11:48:23.942583+00:00"}

Experienced Python developer in computer vision needed to create a desktop application. The main goal is the accurate reading of playing card values in real-time, in the game of Baccarat at online casinos with live dealers, and in accordance with the configuration set in the application's Settings area, which will command the closure and subsequent reopening of the same website that was open (the online casino page). Project Description The software must be capable of operating on any online casino that offers live dealer Baccarat, regardless of the software provider (e.g., Evolution Gaming, Ezugi, etc.) or the user\u2019s screen resolution (from 720p screens to next-gen UHD displays). Required Features: 1. Real-Time Recognition of Baccarat Cards: \u25cf The application must identify and read the value of cards dealt in live Baccarat tables at online casinos. \u25cf Recognition must be highly accurate (100%) and in real-time (15-30 FPS latency) despite slight variations in card position (up to 7mm displacement). \u25cf Computer vision must be implemented using lightweight neural networks (e.g., YOLOv5 or YOLOv8) for dynamic object detection. \u25cf The system must capture the full screen and process it to recognize cards, IMPORTANT: adapting to any screen configuration or resolution without relying on fixed coordinates. 2. Dynamic Reading of Casino URL: \u25cf The software must be able to identify and read the URL of the currently active online casino in the browser. 3. Settings System and Automated Closing Rules (Trigger): \u25cf The application must include a graphical configuration interface accessible via a \"gear\" icon on the main window (top-right corner). \u25cf In this area, the user will define \u201ctrigger\u201d rules based on the sum of the dealt cards. \u25cf Rules for the first two cards (PLAYER and BANKER): \u25cf The user will specify two-card sum values for PLAYER (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9) and BANKER that will trigger the rule. \u25cf If the sum of the first two cards of PLAYER or BANKER (according to configuration) matches the defined values, the software must execute an immediate action. \u25cf Rules for the third card (PLAYER and BANKER): \u25cf The user may configure rules for when PLAYER and/or BANKER receives a third card and the total sum of all three cards reaches a specified value. \u25cf Trigger Action: When one of the trigger rules is met: \u25cf The software must immediately close the entire browser where the online casino is being played. This shutdown must be abrupt, without waiting for the end of the round or animations. \u25cf After closing, the software must wait 3 seconds (time.sleep) and then reopen the same browser at the URL that was active before the shutdown. \u25cf The closing and reopening functionality must be compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.). User Interface (UI): \u25cf The interface should be simple and display the recognized card values one by one as they appear on the screen. \u25cf Card values should be displayed in plain text format using Arial font, size 24 or 26, clearly spaced and centered on the interface. \u25cf When a \u201ctrigger\u201d event is activated, a quick on-screen message should display: \"Cerrando ventana por reglas aplicadas\". Key Technical Considerations: \u25cf Programming Language: Python. \u25cf Computer Vision: Use of libraries such as OpenCV and detection model frameworks (YOLOv5/YOLOv8). \u25cf Web/Desktop Automation: Possible use of libraries like `subprocess`, `webbrowser`, `PyAutoGUI`, or `psutil` for browser control. \u25cf Graphical Interface: `tkinter` or `PyQt` can be used for the UI. \u25cf Delivery of the complete Python source code. \u25cf It is appreciated that the points presented under \"Key Technical Considerations\" are the ones used by the developer applying. \u25cf Additional: We do not want to work with Tesseract OCR. We do not want to work via screenshot with a fixed region or using screen coordinates. We expect a precise and efficient solution that meets the detailed requirements. Previous experience in automation projects, computer vision, and system process management is highly valued.", "skills": ["Computer Vision", "Desktop Application", "Computer Vision", "Desktop Application", "Graphical User Interface (GUI)", "Image Processing", "OpenCV"], "ClientRating": 5.0, "ClientReviews": 8, "timestamp": "2025-07-28T17:52:34.850975+00:00"}
